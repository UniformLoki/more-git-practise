linked lists are made of nodes
a node contains two pieces of information
    1)data - the items interest
    2)link - the memory location of the next node
    
items are not necessarily stored in contiguous memory locations
can grow and shrink in size
not as fast as an array because the next item might not be adjacent in memory
due to each node also having a link, the linked list requires more space

first node is referred to as the head
and the last node is he tail
linear structure
