top most node is called a root node and has child nodes branching from it which create their own child nodes
when you run out of child nodes you get leafs
Level is the vertical placement from the root
children is the nodes one level below a nod of interest. max possible children per node in a binary tree is 2
leaf is a node with no children
subtree is a portion of the tree
Balanced: not lopsided, for any node the hieght of the left and right subtrees differ by no more than 1
if a tree is balanced, then there will be no more than ceiling(log_2(n)) levels

for any tree the left child if smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger (or equal to)

best represented as an array

left childe: 2i +1
right childe: 2i + 2

if child is at i, then the parent is a floor((i-1)/2)
