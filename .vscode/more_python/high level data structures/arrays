an array can only hold one type of data
if one thing in an array is an integer, then everything in it must be an integer
arrays are fixed in size
all items are stored contiguously in memory

arrays are fast because all the information will always be in a specific place and will always be a usable data type
the index is the location in memory and the value is the data
arrays are linear
