Concepts:

getters/accessors
    - used to add functionality when getting state(attributes)
    - In many languages, the developers can decide that the state is "private"
    meaning it can only be changed from within the class. Python is not like this


setters/mutators
    - used to add functionality when setting state
    - In many languages, the developers can decide that the state is "private"
    meaning it can only be changed from within the class. Python is not like this

decorators
    -a way to modify a function in python 
    - Ex: Property

syntactic sugar
    -the idea of a programming language providing a simple way to accomplish something more complex

Class diagrams:
    represented by writing the class name in a box in upper_cammel_case
    EX: AirVehichle, GroundVehichle
    Use a solid arrow to indicate relationshp
    a dotted line to show that an object includes an item

    Vehichle includes: year, make, model, and engine
    year : int
    make: setters
    model: str
    engine: engine

    go_forward()
    go_backward()
    turn(direction_str)

    Engine: kind, hp
    kind: str
    hp: int
    start()

    Car: make, model, num_doors
    make: str
    model: str
    num_doors: int
